# Welcome to my project ðŸ¦Š

## Personal Portofolio

### Description

I created a portfolio project that functions flawlessly on all devices and is particularly targeted at recruiters. The website is incredibly responsive and user-friendly thanks to a mobile-first strategy and thoughtfully placed breakpoints.

I'm loading the projects from a JSON file for increased freedom, and I've made an object inside the container for content display. This makes it simple for me to add new projects or make adjustments without having to code. Additionally, I added a URL check for the live code, so if it's not accessible, the source code will be shown.

Additionally, I drew a background using the Canvas API to give the content depth and a captivating visual allure.

With media query breakpoints set at 700, 1000, and 1300px, the website is optimised for screens with resolutions ranging from 320px to 4k, enabling a flawless layout on different devices.
